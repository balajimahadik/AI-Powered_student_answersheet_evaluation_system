🧠 AI-Powered Student Answer Sheet Evaluation System
📌 Overview

The AI-Powered Student Answer Sheet Evaluation System is a web-based application that automates the evaluation of handwritten student answer sheets using OCR, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing (NLP).
The system is designed to reduce manual effort, improve accuracy, and provide fair and consistent grading with detailed feedback.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Backend: Python, Flask

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Database: MySQL

Artificial Intelligence: Machine Learning, NLP

Computer Vision: OCR, OpenCV, YOLOv8

🧠 Role of NLP in the System

Natural Language Processing (NLP) plays a key role in evaluating textual answers after OCR converts handwritten content into digital text.

NLP is used to:

Perform grammar checking

Perform spell checking

Analyze context relevance and semantic similarity

Compare student answers with model answers

Support evaluation when model answers are unavailable using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

This ensures meaningful and intelligent answer evaluation beyond simple keyword matching.

🚀 Main Features

Handwritten answer recognition using OCR

NLP-based grammar, spelling, and context analysis

Machine Learning–based answer evaluation

Block diagram detection and evaluation using YOLOv8

Evaluation with or without model answers

Automatic marks calculation

Student performance report generation

Web-based interface for teachers

🧩 System Workflow

Handwritten answer sheets are uploaded as scanned PDFs or images

OCR converts handwritten text into digital text

NLP analyzes grammar, spelling, and context relevance

Machine Learning compares student answers with model answers

YOLOv8 evaluates block diagrams when present

Marks are calculated and stored in MySQL

Final performance report is generated

✅ Advantages

Saves time compared to manual evaluation

High recognition accuracy (98–100%)

Fair and unbiased grading

Handles handwriting variations

Supports text and diagram-based answers

Scalable for large-scale examinations

🏁 Conclusion

The AI-Powered Student Answer Sheet Evaluation System combines Python, Flask, NLP, Machine Learning, and Computer Vision to create an efficient and intelligent grading platform.
The system closely matches manual evaluation while providing faster results and detailed feedback, making it suitable for modern educational environments.
